   * `Puzzles & Solutions <puzzles.html>`_


General
=======

* Rewrite exact_cover_dlx.py in C as an extension module.

* Complete unit tests.

* Implement a graphical front-end.  Ideas:

  - The ability to turn pieces on or off, and control the number of
    instances of each piece.

* Restore state from a solution file instead of from a saved state
  file?  I.e. use the last solution in the solution file to simulate a
  saved state file.

* Add multiprocessing support.


Puzzles
=======
