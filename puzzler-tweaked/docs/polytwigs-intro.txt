**Polytwigs** (a.k.a. polycules) are polyforms constructed from unit
line segments (edges) joined end-to-end on a regular hexagonal grid.
Unit line segments on a square grid are called "polysticks", so
polytwigs could also be called "polysticks on a hexagonal grid" or
"hexagonal-grid polysticks" or "hexagonal polysticks".  The polytwigs
are a subset of the polytrigs (triangular-grid polysticks); polytwigs
would fit on a polytrig grid, but there are a lot fewer of them.

Here is a puzzle containing all the polytwigs of order 1 through 5:

.. image:: images/twigs/polytwigs-12345-inset-rectangle-5x5.png

And here is a puzzle containing all the hexatwigs (order 6):

.. image:: images/twigs/hexatwigs-triangle.png

See `Polytwigs: Puzzles & Solutions`_ for many more puzzles.

Most of the polytwigs of order N can be thought of as the projective
duals of the polyiamonds of order N+1 (i.e., joining the centers of
the triangles of a hexiamond results in a pentatwig).  The exceptions
are the polytwigs with loops (e.g. the "O06" hexatwig), which are
duals of the same order or lower-order polyiamonds.

I invented the name "polytwigs" because "hexagonal-grid polysticks" is
too unwieldy, especially when combined with order-prefixes (mono-,
di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.; "hexagonal-grid tristicks"!?).  The name
comes from "twig" being a small stick, often bent and branching.
"Polytwig" is also similar to "polytrig", the name I invented for
triangular-grid polytsicks.  I hope these names catch on.


Prior Research
==============

When I began working on the hexagonal-grid polysticks, I was unable to
find any references to prior research.  While (to my knowledge)
nothing seems to have been published, I couldn't believe that this was
a completely novel idea — an intuition that proved to be true.

In February 2012 I received email from Mr. Colin F. Brown, a puzzle
enthusiast from Dudley, England, who shared the results of his
unpublished work on hexagonal-grid polysticks from the late 1970s and
early 1980s.  Mr. Brown wrote,

    I did name them **‘Polycules’**, from the fact that sea sponges
    have spicules that resemble a tri-cule (your 3-stick hexagon
    gridded ‘polytwig’) each segment being set at 120° apart.  I also
    gave each pentacule a name...

See the `Wikipedia article on "sponge spicules"`__ for an image
demonstrating the resemblance.  In fact, Mr. Brown used the term
"polycules" for sqare-grid polysticks and triangular-grid polytrigs as
well (prefixed with "rectangular-", "triangular-", and "hexagonal-"),
but:

    ... for constructional problems, I chose the hexagonal stick
    forms, partly because the rectangular and triangular types
    admitted tilings and constructions with ‘crossings’ – impossible
    with polytwigs.

I'll use "polycules" as a synonym for "polytwigs" here.  Mr. Brown's
pentacule names are listed in the pentatwigs_ section below.  See
`Polytwigs: Puzzles & Solutions`_ for examples of several of
Mr. Brown's puzzle constructions.

__ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge_spicule

Mr. Brown also explored the quasi-tritwigs with gaps between segments
limited to length-1; see `Quasi-Polyforms`_ below.

At the Gathering for Gardner 10 (G4G10, 2012), Les Shader gave me a
copy of a page from a Russian journal "Charade" ("ШАРАДА"), N6(6),
December 1993.  It featured a solution to the "Hexonet" puzzle
("ГЕКСОСЕТИ"), exactly the `pentatwigs triangle`__ (side length 5).

Polyforms
=========

The number and names of the various orders of polytwigs are as follows:

=====  ==========  ===========  ===========
Order  | Polyform  | Free       | One-Sided
       | Name      | Polytwigs  | Polytwigs
=====  ==========  ===========  ===========
1      monotwig    1            1
2      ditwig      1            1
3      tritwigs    3            4
4      tetratwigs  4            6
5      pentatwigs  12           19
6      hexatwigs   27           49
7      heptatwigs  78           143
=====  ==========  ===========  ===========

The numbers of polytwigs can also be found in the following sequences
from `The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
<http://oeis.org>`_: A197459_ (free) and A197460_ (one-sided).

.. _A197459: http://oeis.org/A197459
.. _A197460: http://oeis.org/A197460

Examples of the polytwigs from order 1 (monotwig) to order 6
(hexatwigs) are given in the tables below.

The polytwigs are named with a letter-number scheme, like "I1", "C3",
and "R16".  The letter part is the letter of the alphabet that the
polytwig most closely resembles.  In some cases, that resemblance is
weak, and the letters are arbitrary.  The final digit of the number
represents the polyform order (how many line segments are in the
polytwig).  There are more hexatwigs than letters in the alphabet, so
their names have an extra middle digit (numbered from 0) to
differentiate the variations.

.. _table legend:

In the tables below, "Aspects" refers to the number of unique
orientations that a polyform may take (different rotations, flipped or
not).  This varies with the symmetry of the polyform.

The "One-Sided" column identifies polyforms that are asymmetrical in
reflection.  Treating the flipped and unflipped versions of
asymmetrical polytwigs as distinct polyforms (and disallowing further
reflection or "flipping"), results in "one-sided" polytwigs and
puzzles.

Quasi-Polyforms
===============

Quasi-polyforms are polyforms where the requirement that all unit
shapes be connected has been removed.  In other words, quasi-polyforms
are polyforms where some or all unit shapes may be separate from the
others.

Without limits on the distance between unit shapes there would be an
infinite number of quasi-polyforms (for orders 2 and above).  We will
limit the quasi-polyforms we consider to those with length-1 gaps
between segments.

The number and names of the various orders of quasi-polytwigs are as
follows:

=====  ================  ===========  ===========
Order  | Polyform        | Free       | One-Sided
       | Name            | Polytwigs  | Polytwigs
=====  ================  ===========  ===========
1      monotwig [*]_     1            1
2      quasi-ditwig      3            4
3      quasi-tritwigs    17           28
4      quasi-tetratwigs  114          214
5      quasi-pentatwigs  966          1885
=====  ================  ===========  ===========

.. [*] With only 1 line segment, there can be no disconnected
       quasi-monotwig.  The set of the regular (fully-connected)
       monotwigs is identical to the set of quasi-monotwigs, and
       consists of one piece: the "I1" monotwig.

Examples of the quasi-polytwigs of order 2 (quasi-ditwigs) and order 3
(quasi-tritwigs) are given in the tables below.  See the `table
legend`_ above for column descriptions.


Quasi-Ditwigs
-------------

There are 3 free quasi-ditwigs (order-2 quasi-polytwigs) and 4
one-sided quasi-ditwigs:

Quasi-Tritwigs
--------------

In his `prior research`_, Colin F. Brown showed that in addition to
the 3 free connected tritwigs, there are 5 semi-connected (one gap)
quasi-tritwigs and 9 disconnected (two gaps) quasi-tritrigs, for a
total of 17 free quasi-tritwigs (order-3 quasi-polytwigs).  There are
28 one-sided quasi-tritwigs.

Coordinate System
=================

Polytwig puzzles use a pseudo-3D skewed coordinate system, where the X
and Y axes are 60° apart instead of the usual 90°.  The typical
representation (as seen in the Polyform Puzzler solution data files)
positions the Y axis vertically with the X axis 30° counter-clockwise
from horizontal.  Solution graphics are often rotated so the X axis is
horizontal, and the Y axis 30° clockwise from vertical.

The (X,Y) 2-dimensional coordinate identifies the lower-left corner of
the (X,Y) hexagon in a polyhex grid (a honeycomb with hexagons with
horizontal tops & bottoms).  The three line segments emanating from
this point share the (X,Y) coordinate, and the Z dimension is used for
the direction of the line segment:

| z = 0: 0° horizontal, to the right;
| z = 1: 120° counter-clockwise, up and to the left;
| z = 2: 240° counter-clockwise, down and to the left.

Since only three line segments may emanate from each (X,Y)
intersection, there is no possibility for polytwigs to cross each
other and no need to keep track of intersections.  This separates
polytwigs from polysticks and polytrigs, where such considerations are
crucial.
