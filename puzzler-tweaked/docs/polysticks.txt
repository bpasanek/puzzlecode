Polysticks of Order 1 Through 3
===============================

These puzzles use the 1 monostick, 2 disticks, and 5 tristicks, for
a total of 20 line segments on the square grid.

* 4x4 grid with clipped corners:

Tetrasticks
===========

One-Sided Welded Tetrasticks
----------------------------

The "welded" tetrasticks are those that contain junction points, or
welds, and therefore do not form simple connected paths (in other
words, they branch).  There are 6 welded tetrasticks, 4 of which are
asymmetrical, therefore there are 10 one-sided welded tetrasticks.

* 5x5 grid: `3 solutions

* Triangle: `9 solutions

* Trapezoid: `7 solutions
  <../solutions/sticks/one-sided-welded-tetrasticks-trapezoid.txt>`__

  .. image:: images/sticks/one-sided-welded-tetrasticks-trapezoid.png


15 of 16 Tetrasticks
--------------------

Due to an imbalance in horizontal/vertical parity, the 16 tetrasticks
cannot be formed into a symmetrical shape.  But by omitting one of the
five tetrasticks that have an excess of 2 vertical or horizontal line
segments (H, J, L, N, or Y), symmetrical shapes can be formed.

* 6x6 grid: `1795 solutions
  <../solutions/sticks/tetrasticks-6x6.txt>`__

  In this solution, the "Y" piece is omitted:

  .. image:: images/sticks/tetrasticks-6x6.png

* Aztec Diamond of order 3: `3 solutions
  <../solutions/sticks/tetrasticks-aztec-diamond.txt>`__

  In this solution, the "J" piece is omitted:

  .. image:: images/sticks/tetrasticks-aztec-diamond.png


One-Sided Tetrasticks
---------------------

9 of the 16 tetrasticks are asymmetrical, therefore there are 25
one-sided tetrasticks.

* 5x5 diamond lattice: `107 solutions
  <../solutions/sticks/one-sided-tetrasticks-5x5-diamond-lattice.txt>`__

  .. image:: images/sticks/one-sided-tetrasticks-5x5-diamond-lattice.png

  Calculating all 107 non-isomorphic solutions took approximately **11
  weeks** using one core of a 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo E6750 CPU
  (Python 2.6.6, Windows XP) on an otherwise idle and always-on
  machine.  The calculated solutions correspond to those listed in
  `"Covering the Aztec Diamond with One-sided Tetrasticks, Extended
  Version", by Alfred Wassermann, University of Bayreuth`__.
  (Wassermann, and Knuth before him, mistakenly called the shape an
  "aztec diamond", but an `aztec diamond is a subtly different
  shape`__.  This puzzle actually corresponds to a `centered square
  number`__.)

  __ http://did.mat.uni-bayreuth.de/~alfred/home/index.html
  __ http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AztecDiamond.html
  __ http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CenteredSquareNumber.html

  The solution above is number 9 in Wassermann's paper, and number 58
  in the `Polyform Puzzler solutions`__.  Both Wassermann's and the
  Polyform Puzzler solution sets are split into six sub-puzzles by
  position of the "X" piece, and correspond as follows:

  ================  ==========  =========
  X-Position (sub-puzzle)
  ----------------------------  ---------
  Polyform Puzzler  Wassermann  Solutions
  ================  ==========  =========
  A (symmetrical)   6           19
  B                 5           36
  C (symmetrical)   2           11
  D                 4           19
  E                 1           15
  F                 3           7
  ================  ==========  =========

  __ ../solutions/sticks/one-sided-tetrasticks-5x5-diamond-lattice.txt

  Note: The Polyform Puzzler order for the X-positions is in
  increasing distance from the center of the puzzle.  Wassermann's
  order is as follows: with all X-piece possitions in the upper-left
  quadrant in two horizontal rows (rotate the diagrams in the paper
  90Â° clockwise), ordered from left to right, top to bottom.
  Symmetrical X-positions (X-piece on the diagonal) have the I-piece
  limited to horizontal for both Polyform Puzzler and Wassermann (when
  rotated as noted above).

Seven-Segment Digits
====================

The pieces in this puzzle are modeled after the seven-segment display
digits 0 through 9, as seen on digital watches, for a total of 49 line
segments.  Based on the "Digigrams" puzzle (AKA "Count On Me" or
"Count Me In") by Martin H. Watson.

In the following puzzle, the digit pairs (2, 5) and (6, 9) are
considered identical for the sake of counting solutions (preventing
duplicate solutions). Also note that the 0 digit has a gap in one long
side, allowing the 1 or 7 digit to intersect and occupy the 0 digit's
otherwise enclosed central line segment.

* 6x5 grid: `5 solutions
  <../solutions/sticks/seven-segment-digits-6x5.txt>`__

  .. image:: images/sticks/seven-segment-digits-6x5.png

  Unfortunately, there are no solutions where all of the digits are
  unflipped.  For example, in the solution above, the green 2 digit is
  flipped and appears as a second 5.
