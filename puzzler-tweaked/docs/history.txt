  instead of the number of squares.

* Added a Sudoku puzzle solver.

* API changes: moved the "convert_matrix" function into the ExactCover
  class and renamed as the "load_matrix" method; changed
  ExactCover.__init__ to allow the matrix to be passed in at
  instantiation time. Also improved test output.

* Added a second implementation of the exact cover solver,
  exact_cover_x2.py, based on `code by Ali Assaf
  <http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~aassaf9/python/algorithm_x.html>`__.

* Added the ability to report on the current search state (partial
  solution), useful for long-running puzzles
  (``-R``/``--report-search-state``).

* Split the enormous puzzler/puzzles.py module into a package of
  smaller modules, in puzzler/puzzles/.
