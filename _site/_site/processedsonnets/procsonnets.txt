From fairøest creaøtures we deøsire inøcrease,
That thereøby beauøty's rose might neøver die,
But, as the riøper should by time deøcease,
His tenøder heir might bear his meømorøy.
But thou, conøtractøed to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-subøstanøtial fuel,
Maøking a faømine where aøbundøance lies,
Thyøself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh orønaøment
And onøly herøald to the gauødy spring
Wiøthin thine own bud burøiest thy conøtent
And, tenøder churl, mak'st waste in nigøgardøing.
  Piøty the world, or  else this glutøton be--
  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

2

When forøty winøters shall beøsiege thy brow
And dig deep trenøches in thy beauøty's field,
Thy youth's proud liøverøy, so gazed on now,
Will be a tatøtered weed of small worth held.
Then beøing asked where all thy beauøty lies,
Where all the treaøsure of thy lusøty days,
To say withøin thine own deep-sunkøen eyes
Were an all-eatøing shame and thriftøless praise.
How much more praise deøserved thy beauøty's use
If thou couldst anøswer "This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old exøcuse,"
Provøing his beauøty by sucøcesøsion thine.
  This were to be new made when thou art old
  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

3

Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form aønothøer,
Whose fresh reøpair if  now thou not reønewest,
Thou dost beøguile the world, unøbless some mothøer.
For where is she so fair whose unøeared womb
Disødains the tilølage of thy husøbanødry?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his self-love, to stop posøterøiøty?
Thou art thy mothøer's glass, and she in thee
Calls back the loveøly Apøril of her prime;
So thou through winødows of thine age shalt see,
Deøspite of wrinkøles, this thy goldøen time.
  But if thou live reømemøbered not to be,
  Die sinøgle, and thine imøage dies with thee.

4

Unøthriftøy loveøliøness, why dost thou spend
Uøpon thyøself thy beauøty's leøgaøcy?
Naøture's beøquest gives nothøing but doth lend,
And beøing frank, she lends to those are free.
Then, beauøteous nigøgard, why dost thou aøbuse
The bountøeous largøess givøen thee to give?
Proføitøless usøurøer, why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
For, havøing traføfic with thyøself aølone,
Thou of thyøself thy sweet self dost deøceive.
Then how, when naøture calls thee to be gone,
What acøceptøaøble audøit canst thou leave?
  Thy unøused beauøty must be tombed with thee,
  Which usøed  lives th'exøecøuøtor to be.

5

Those hoøurs that with  genøtle  work did frame
The loveøly gaze where evøery eye doth dwell
Will play the tyørants to the verøy same
And that unøfair which fairøly doth exøcel;
For nevøer-restøing time leads sumømer on
To hidøeous wintøer and conøfounds him there,
Sap checked with frost and lustøy leaves quite gone,
Beauøty o'er-snowed and bareøness evøeryøwhere.
Then, were not sumømer's disøtilløaøtion left
A liøquid prisøoner pent in  walls of glass,
Beauøty's eføfect with beauøty were beøreft,
Nor it nor no reømemøbrance what it was.
  But flowers disøtilled, though  they with winøter meet,
  Leese but their show; their subøstance still lives sweet.

6

Then let not winøter's ragøged hand deøface
In thee thy sumømer ere thou be disøtilled.
Make sweet some viøal; treaøsure thou some place
With beauøty's treaøsure ere it be self-killed.
That use is not forøbidøden usøurøy
Which hapøpies those that pay the wiløling loan;
That's for thyøself to breed aønothøer thee,
Or ten times hapøpier, be it ten for one.
Ten times thyøself were hapøpier than thou art
If ten of thine ten times reøfigøured thee;
Then what could death do if thou shouldst deøpart,
Leaøving thee livøing in posøterøitøy?
  Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fair
  To be death's conøquest and make worms thine heir.

7

Lo, in the orøient when the graøcious light
Lifts up his burnøing head, each unøder eye
Doth homøage to his new-apøpearøing sight,
Serøving with looks his saøcred majøestøy;
And havøing climbed the steep-up heavøenly hill,
Reøsemøbling strong youth in his midødle age,
Yet morøtal looks aødore his beauøty still,
Atøtendøing on his goldøen piløgrimøage.
But when from highømost pitch with wearøy car
Like feeøble age he reeløeth from the day,
The eyes, 'fore duøteous, now conøverøted are
From his low tract and look aønothøer way.
  So thou, thyøself outøgoøing in thy noon,
  Unølooked on diøest unless thou get a son.

8

Muøsic to hear, why hear'st thou muøsic sadøly?
Sweets with sweets war not, joy deølights in joy.
Why lov'st thou that which thou reøceiv'st not gladøly,
Or else reøceiv'st with pleaøsure thine anønoy?
If the true conøcord of well-tunøed sounds,
By unøions marøried, do oføfend thine ear,
They do but sweetøly chide thee, who conøfounds
In sinøgleøness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
Mark how one string, sweet husøband to aønothøer,
Strikes each in each by mutøual  orøderøing,
Resemøbling sire and child and hapøpy  mothøer
Who, all in one, one pleasøing note do sing;
  Whose speechøless song, being manøy, seemøing one,
  Sings this to thee: "Thou sinøgle wilt prove none."

9

Is it for fear to wet a widøow's eye
That thou conøsum'st thyøself in sinøgle life?
Ah, if thou isøsueøless shalt hap to die,
The world will wail thee like a makeøless wife;
The world will be thy widøow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left beøhind,
When evøery priøvate wiødow well may keep,
By chilødren's eyes, her husøband's shape in mind.
Look what an unøthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place, for still the world enøjoys it;
But beauøty's waste hath in the world an end,
And, kept unøused, the uøser so desøtroys it.
  No love toward otøhers in that bosøom sits
That on himøself such murød'rous shame comømits.

10

For shame denøy that thou bear'st love to anøy,
Who for thyøself art so unøprovøiødent.
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beøloved of manøy,
But that thou none lov'st is most evøiødent.
For thou art so posøsessed with murdø'rous hate
That 'gainst thyøself thou stick'st not to conøspire,
Seekøing that beauøteous roof to ruøiønate
Which to reøpair should be thy chief deøsire.
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind.
Shall hate be fairøer lodged than genøtle love?
Be as thy preøsence is, graøcious and kind,
Or to thyøself at least kind-heartøed prove.
  Make thee aønothøer self for love of me,
  That beauøty still may live in thine or thee.


11

As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st
In one of thine, from that which thou deøpartøest;
And that fresh blood which youngøly thou beøstow'st
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth conøvertøest.
Hereøin lives wisødom, beauøty, and inøcrease;
Withøout this, foløly, age, and  cold deøcay.
If all were mindøed so, the times should cease,
And threeøscore year would make the world aøway.
Let those whom naøture hath not made for store,
Harsh, featøureøless, and rude, barørenøly peørish;
Look whom she best  enødowed she gave the more,
Which bountøeous gift thou shouldst in bounøty cherøish.
  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereøby
  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copøy die.

12

When I do count the clock that tells the time
And see the brave day sunk in hidøeous night,
When I beøhold the viøoølet past prime
And saøble curls all siløvered o'er with white;
When loføty trees I see barøren of leaves,
Which erst from heat did canøoøpy the herd,
And sumømer's green all girdøed up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and brisøtly beard;
Then of thy beauøty do I questøion make
That thou aømong the wastes of time must go,
Since sweets and beauøties do themøselves forøsake
And die as fast as they see othøers grow;
  And nothøing 'gainst Time's scythe can make deøfense
  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

13

O, that you were your self! But, love, you are
No longøer yours than you yourøself here live;
Aøgainst this comøing end you should preøpare,
And your sweet semøblance to some othøer give.
So should that beauøty which you hold in lease
Find no deøtermøinøaøtion; then you were
Your self aøgain aføter yourøself's deøcease
When your sweet isøsue your sweet form should bear.
Who lets so fair a house fall to deøcay,
Which husøbanødry in honøor might upøhold
Aøgainst the stormøy gusts of winøter's day
And barøren rage of death's eøternøal cold?
  O, none but unøthrifts, dear my love, you know.
  You had a fatøher; let your son say so.

14

Not from the stars do I my judgøment pluck,
And yet meøthinks I have aøstronøomøy--
But not to tell of good or eøvil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasøons' qualøitøy;
Nor can I fortøune to brief minøutes tell,
Pointøing to each his thunøder, rain, and wind,
Or say with prinøces if it shall go well
By oft preødict that I in heavøen find.
But from thine eyes my knowløedge I deørive,
And, conøstant stars, in them I read such art
As truth and beauøty shall toøgethøer thrive
If from thyøself to store thou wouldst conøvert;
  Or else of thee this I progønosøtiøcate:
  Thy end is truth's and beauøty's doom and date.

15

When I conøsidøer eveøryøthing that grows
Holds in perøfecøtion but a littøle moøment,
That this huge stage preøsentøeth nought but shows
Whereøon the stars in seøcret inøfluence commøent;
When I perøceive that men as plants inøcrease,
Cheered and checked eøven by the selføsame sky,
Vaunt in their youthøful sap, at height deøcrease,
And wear their brave state out of memøorøy;
Then the conøceit of this inøconøstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth beøfore my sight,
Where wasteøful Time deøbatøeth with Deøcay
To change your day of youth to sulølied night;
  And, all in war with Time for love of you,
  As he takes from you, I enøgraft you new.

16

But whereøfore do not you a mightøier way
Make war uøpon this bloodøy tyørant Time,
And fortøiøfy yourøself in your deøcay
With means more blesøsed than my barøren rhyme?
Now stand you on the top of hapøpy hours,
And manøy maidøen gardøens, yet unøset,
With virøtuous wish would bear your liøving flowers,
Much likøer than your paintøed countøerøfeit.
So should the lines of life that life reøpair
Which this time's penøcil or my puøpil pen
Neiøther in inøward worth nor outøward fair
Can make you live yourøself in eyes of men.
  To give aøway yourøself keeps yourøself still,
  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.

17

Who will beølieve my verse in time to come
If it were filled with your most high deøserts?
Though yet, heaøven knows, it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
If I could write the beauøty of your eyes
And in fresh numøbers numøber all your graøces,
The age to come would say "This poøet lies;
Such heavøenøly touchøes ne'er touched earthøly faøces."
So should my papøers, yelløowed with their age,
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
And your true rights be termed a poøet's rage
And stretchøed  meøter of an anøtique song.
  But were some child of yours aølive that time,
  You should live twice--in it and in my rhyme.
