### The Increase Puzzle Project
Our group is currently working to create convert a sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets into pentomino puzzles. These will be laser cut from wood, acrylic, and other materials, and then assembled as an art-object titled _Increase_. Preparing the the puzzles requires finding ways to pack pentomino shapes into a sonnet-shaped frame. Working by hand, we've carved up several sonnets into a set of pentomino shapes but we hope to do better, finding all possible solutions to our sequence of sonnets, that is, all the ways that a given sonnet can be cut up into pentomino shapes.

More puzzle projects are forthcoming.
