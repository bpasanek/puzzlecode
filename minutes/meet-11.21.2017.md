### Minutes
A different kid of meeting: we read three pieces of literary criticism. Discussion of I.A. Richards, Paul Fussell, and a piece from a selection from a piece from "Poetics Today" on Richards puzzle-cutting antics. 

See:
* I.A. Richards, Practical Criticism: A Study of Literary Judgment (Harcourt and Brace, 1929).
* Paul Fussell's discussion of the "Structural Principles" of the sonnet form in Poetic Meter and Poetic Form, rev. ed. (McGraw-Hill, 1979), 109-126.
* Chanita Goodblatt and Joseph Glickson, "Conversations with I.A. Richards: The Renaissance in Cognitive LIterary Studies," Poetics Today 31:3 (Fall 2010): 387-432. See especially the image of Richards's teaching materials included at p. 392.

Jordan Burke on Kantian heritage" pointing to ascription  
Neal on interdependence: rhythm, sound, sense
The sound alone... Blasing on lyric poetry: babble as the core or foundation of poetry.  
The purified dummy: the subformal -- just the syllables  

Worthy asks why is this sub-formalist?

JBurke: form in Levine, she goes down to the syllable  
JBuysse: hyperformal... too local, too few use cases  
    Hyperformalism is about discovery...  
    In fact, it's hard to distinguish the two in our case?  
   
Discovery of fingerprint of intentionality? -- when you follow Fineman.

Worthy wants us to think about intentional fallacy and code.  
Ascribe responsibility but not intent.. (Worthy's distinction)  

Early on in creative programs... system being used is mathematical formalism (recursive function theory). Can only come out of the system (system did come up with beautiful theorems):   
    Discouraging for mathematicians: from finite axioms, all the stuff can be mechanically derived.  
    GÃ¶del steps in here. Whatever we think of as just arithmetic is a domain richer than one axiom system can specify.
Neal discovery not invented? --  

Jeremy worries takes away from creation... already out there, no ownership.  
All the visual metaphors, says Andie.  

The poem that is already in the Shakespeare poem  
It was there the whole time? ---  

Fussell -- JBurke -- is this a satirical project? -- Pulling 

Couplet as in between stichic and strophic? -- More opportunities for doing puzzle.  
Looking at mosaic... in Fussell (113).

Poe on the length of a poem: it should only be as long as a sitting. Good poets get longer sittings.  
A wall-sized crossword puzzle, community effort.  
Rhythm patterns that go over 100 200. Counting to 17, 300 times in a row.  

History of lit crit: Jakobson  
Form is whatever you attend to...  
Lyric is attending to something weakly...  


Brad meeting with Jeremy afterwards about algorithms  
Two functions  
1. Board size and piece size 14x10 and 5, say -- pieceification.  
2. Give a board and the actual pieces (similar to C+ algorithm)
