### Spiel from Neal:  
Brad and I/Neal are whipping something up for publication in CUNY's Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy (due next week, yikes!).
Might be useful to get some quotations from some of you guys about the pedagogical value of the puzzles, what the experience of solving them is like, but more from you guys what the experience of DESIGNING them is like. We’ll of course credit you for any quotes you give us! And this is an opportunity to drum up interest about our project in the larger academe sphere.

Now that the competition is over, we’re thinking about next immediate steps:  
BIGGER, BETTER competition in spring, bringing in competitors from the entire english department, the A-School, and computer science department
I’ve hired a comic book artist to illustrate some promotional material that’ll go up on our website and that we can make use of in the spring when we start advertising for the bigger competition.
Now is the time to submit a pitch for your own puzzle idea. If you’ve already received training on the laser cutters, it’s better to implement what you’ve learned sooner rather than later. Once you get your pitch into us, we can approve it and provide you with funds to purchase materials and go get your puzzle cut.

Presentation Date  
Brad and I also want to recruit some people to start cutting puzzles for the much-anticipated Increase Project.  
How is web development going, with Jeremy?  

### Minutes
-Clear puzzles don’t work for competition: can we stack them on top of each other  
    But even as you’re layering, you’re not getting a clear text. Maybe a puzzle has a few clear pieces.
-Can create uniform notches on left side/right side.  
-Have some kind of frame  
-open source  
-Evan: a corona as a way to scale it up
    Lady Mary Wroth corona  
    Provide clues for piecing them together  
-Final round: each group’s puzzle becomes part of a larger puzzle they have to solve at the end.  
-Be able to flip the poem over to reveal a clue.  
-Shakespeare’s plays targeted to high schoolers.  
    Poetry Foundation: Poetry Out Loud: every student has to recite at least one poem out loud  
    Figure out what avenues to high school teachers already exist  
    Emphasize the pedagogical value of the puzzles  
        Think about rhythm  
        Iambs are this color, or parts of speech different color  
        
-Question: how much of this extra stuff are we going to put on the puzzle pieces: lots of different  
    This line has a spondee in it  
    This poem has a sestet and an octave  
Andie talking about Jakobson’s division of a Shakespeare sonnet  
    Talking about her Wyatt poem  
Need to write up REALLY DETAILED instructions  

Robert Frost’s Sonnet about Design  
Langston Hughes: Poem about Puzzles: Pathological Puzzle  
Robert Graves: Dance of Words  

Large box, with subgroupings that have to be organized into the correct Sonnet.  

Processional moments in a Masque can get put together  
    Or sequences in the Faerie Queene  
    To show how stanzas can work off of each other  

Clear puzzle: for more complex metrical scheme: fit pieces together but is this a spondee—a sheet with the scanion marking underneath and visible through the clear puzzle pieces.  

"Merciless Beauty" Chaucer, extremely repetitive, a triple rondel.  

Blake and playing with color: Songs of Innocence and Experience, use contrasting colors for side by side poems 

We should test both approaches.

Bloom’s Taxonomy of Thinking.  
    Visual versus Taxonomy
